### [Javascript Keyboard](https://cerealenjoyer.github.io/precourse-projects/week-1/emoPiano/index.html)
<details>
  <summary> Description </summary>
Using lessons from the Javascript30 lesson 'Javascript Drum Kit', I made this (extremely) simple piano. Taking inspiration from films like Grand Piano I made a simulation of a 'musical combination lock', a locked box hidden inside a piano that only unlocks on playing a certain melody - in this case the opening riff from a 'My Chemical Romance' song (hence the name 'emoPiano').
Try listening [to the start of Black Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_uncMEJkBc) and trying to replicate the sequence, or if you're impatient, you can cheat.
