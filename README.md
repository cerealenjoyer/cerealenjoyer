#### Projects

### [Javascript Keyboard](https://cerealenjoyer.github.io/precourse-projects/week-1/emoPiano/index.html)
<details>
  <summary> Description </summary>
Using lessons from the Javascript30 lesson 'Javascript Drum Kit', I made this (extremely) simple piano. Taking inspiration from films like Grand Piano I made a simulation of a 'musical combination lock', a locked box hidden inside a piano that only unlocks on playing a certain melody - in this case the opening riff from a 'My Chemical Romance' song (hence the name 'emoPiano').
Try listening [to the start of Black Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_uncMEJkBc) and trying to replicate the sequence, or if you're impatient, you can cheat.

<summary> ### [CSS and Javascript Clock](https://cerealenjoyer.github.io/precourse-projects/week-1/horrorClock/index.html) </summary>

I made a simple clock in JS and CSS, and decided to try and link it thematically to the previous project: inspired by my wasted youth playing point-'n-click mystery games I made a *Silent Hill* inspired puzzle clock - watching it until the second hand hits '0' causes it to click and shift, unlocking another door.

### [Editing CSS Variables with Javascript](https://cerealenjoyer.github.io/precourse-projects/week-3/css-variables/index.html)

I was really excited to learn about CSS Variables. DOM Manipulation was my favourite part of learning how to build a website, I love the crunchiness of it and I think it's really cool that you can make your JavaScript interact with your HTML, it suddenly makes a website feel like 'serious business'. Adding CSS into the mix feels like the coup de grace.
Inspired by films like Jacob's Ladder, as well as the found-footage photography artwork of Trevor Henderson, I tried to use CSS Variables to make a photo of an everyday tableau 'shift' into a ruined, uncomfortable environment: You can adjust the sliders on the left to add layers of decay onto the photo, and for subtlety you can blur them out with the sliders on the right, to lessen the effect.
